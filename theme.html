				<p>I think the theme is determination. The two families I chose are the Bermudez and Zambrano families. The first example comes from the Bermudez family in the mini-story, “Her Brothers Keeper”. In this mini-story, the younger brother goes to school for the first day. But, after school his sister cannot find him. She did not give up as she was, “determined to find Paco” (Estevis 585). The second example comes from the Zambrano family. In the mini-story, “The Battle of the Blackbirds”, the home baseball team is faced with playing “The Cuervos”. The Cuervos are a much more affluent, and they believe better, team than the home team, the Grackles. The team, “worked on the field most of the morning, stretching string along the baselines, then pouring from a small coffee can, the white chalky lime along the string. Víctor constructed the pitcher’s mound, smoothing and packing the dirt and watering it down until it looked and felt just right to him.” (Estevis 1124). Both of these stories showed a sense of determination as everybody was willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done.

				<p><i>Down Garrapata Road</i>, by Anne Estevis, is about sacrifice, and reveals that people often willingly give up certain things in their life to make someone else’s better, out of loyalty and commitment to those they love. Each character on Garrapata Road has his/her own challenges and triumphs, but they are all united by the sacrifices they make for someone they care about. Zulema Bermudez stayed long after school had ended in a “place where [she] did not want to be. [She] didn’t feel safe there, not now, not anytime” and then walked for many hours to return home, all in order to find and protect her younger brother (Estevis 46). Despite not feeling well, Zulema sacrificed rest for herself and a safe journey home because she cared about her brother Paco and couldn’t bear to leave him alone. In a similar fashion, Roberto voluntarily lives in exile in Mexico, without his family or friends, because he took the blame for killing Evaristo. Roberto, a “prisoner of war for three years, who was starved, abused, and nearly dead, comes home only to become another kind of prisoner all because of his love for a woman” (Estevis 114). He sacrificed his (finally) untroubled life and left his home and family again, just to be with the woman he loved, and to protect her. Sacrifice for family and loved ones is not always as grand as Zulema and Roberto’s sacrifices were, but nonetheless, they change the lives of both people in a significant way.

				<p>Down Garrapata Road, by Anne Estevis, is a novel that goes in-depth into the stories that it presents, and gives the reader an almost-real feel of the culture and its corresponding characteristics. The novel mentioned a principle many times throughout all four of its stories: nothing is more important than family. Before I started reading this novel, I thought that Mexican-American communities in the south were only filled with crime, poverty and hunger. This book showed me a whole new paradigm in the Mexican-American culture. Wherever there was hatred, in the book, bondage and love also equally coexisted around the same area, which goes to show just how perfectly balanced the emotions are in a Mexican-American culture. What makes this book so interesting, is that many of the characters and/or events can be related to something going on in my present-day life. My life stories are kind of amusing, like story #3, where Tedulo(or Teo) Zambrano had to go through a lot of struggles for his childhood. WHen I moved from India, when I was 5 years old, I had trouble speaking english, because the school that I used to attend in India had no English curriculum. Instead, everything was taught in my home language. I had to struggle to communicate, and everyday before I went to school,my mom taught me a list of things i had to say if there was an emergency, like my Father’s phone number, etc. This culture, except for its extensive poverty, is actually a lot like the events going on at my home. This book is a must-read; it is a flowing piece of writing that can be connected to things today, no matter how modern.
