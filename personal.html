				<p>I don’t think I learned much from the novel. While it was an excellent read, it was not very educational, or at least not to me. My perception of the culture changed slightly. While I knew families like the book and in a time like the book did not have the nicest of things, this book showed me that the living conditions were, overall, not too terrible. I can really relate with the story, or at least my mom can. She grew up on a farm in western Pennsylvania. The nearest elementary/middle/high school was around five miles from her house. Family was important and they made what they had work. In my house, the ties to family and helping others aout are all still there as well as working hard to get what we want done.</p>

				<p><i>Down Garrapata Road</i> is a heartwarming book that not only introduced me to Mexican-American culture, but also made me aware of the struggles of living in a poor, minority village during World War II. One of the most important things I learned from the novel is not to take things for granted. I never previously thought much about being able to speak English, but after reading this, I realized what a powerful tool that is (living in the US), and how much I rely on communication in my everyday life. Reading about the conditions the kids of Garrapata Road lived in also made me aware of how privileged I am to have grown up with things I thought were “basic”, like running water, electricity and roads. Prior to reading this, I didn’t know anything about Mexican-American culture, beyond the fact that it was a mixture of both Mexican and American cultures. From the reading and research I’ve conducted, I’ve learned about the values, norms, and customs of Mexican-American culture (although I’m not sure how accurate it is in today’s world, given that the book took place in the 1950s). I can relate to certain characters on Garrapata Road in some ways, such as Zulema and Teo. I relate to Zulema because I am also an older sister, and we both have a certain responsibility over our younger brothers. Being the oldest sibling in the household also brings other responsibilities and privileges, something I share not only with Zulema, but also Chatita, her brothers, and many other children. That aside, the lives of these characters are so very different from mine (living in a poor community and disconnected from the rest of their country), that it was hard for me to relate to them in many other ways. I did however, see similarities between Mexican-American culture and my own (Indian- American) culture. Family is an aspect that is highly valued by both cultures, as well as good hospitality, an importance on education, and facing challenges of being bilingual/belonging to two distinctly different cultures.

				<p>Down Garrapata Road, by Anne Estevis, is a novel that goes in-depth into the stories that it presents, and gives the reader an almost-real feel of the culture and its corresponding characteristics. The novel mentioned a principle many times throughout all four of its stories: nothing is more important than family. Before I started reading this novel, I thought that Mexican-American communities in the south were only filled with crime, poverty and hunger. This book showed me a whole new paradigm in the Mexican-American culture. Wherever there was hatred, in the book, bondage and love also equally coexisted around the same area, which goes to show just how perfectly balanced the emotions are in a Mexican-American culture. What makes this book so interesting, is that many of the characters and/or events can be related to something going on in my present-day life. My life stories are kind of amusing, like story #3, where Tedulo(or Teo) Zambrano had to go through a lot of struggles for his childhood. WHen I moved from India, when I was 5 years old, I had trouble speaking english, because the school that I used to attend in India had no English curriculum. Instead, everything was taught in my home language. I had to struggle to communicate, and everyday before I went to school,my mom taught me a list of things i had to say if there was an emergency, like my Father’s phone number, etc. This culture, except for its extensive poverty, is actually a lot like the events going on at my home. This book is a must-read; it is a flowing piece of writing that can be connected to things today, no matter how modern.</p>
