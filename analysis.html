			<h3>Values</h3>
			<p>In Mexican-American culture, family and loyalty to loved ones is a value that is widely prevalent and important. “Family unity and responsibility are high priorities, with family ties representing lifelong commitments of mutual support” (Mexico: Family). Supporting family, and staying loyal to them is a value that can be seen in the lives and stories of all four families in <i>Down Garrapata Road</i> by Anne Estevis. When Zulema can’t find her brother Paco after school, she spends hours searching for him, and ends up missing the only bus home. She eventually finds him sick and trembling in the nurse’s office, and has to embark on a long walk with him to get home. Despite not feeling well herself, she takes care of him and “held him as tightly as (she) could against (her) body”, wishing she “had the strength to carry him” (Estevis 49). Aside from Zulema, all the other children of Garrapata Road (Chatita, Paco, Teo, and Nilda) all put their family before them in some way or another, and recognize the importance of family even at a young age.</p>

			<h3>Symbol</h3>
			<p>The Virgin of Guadalupe is an iconic religious symbol of Mexican-American culture. An aspect shared with traditional Mexican culture, the Virgin of Guadalupe is a sacred figure symbolizing protection, purity, and motherhood. She is treated with reverence, and her presence is thought to cure diseases and provide strength (Mexico: Religion). In <i>Down Garrapata Road</i> by Anne Estevis, Doña Fidelfa claims to see the Blessed Virgin on her privy door, and people “came from distant towns….and local farms to look at the privy door. Many prayed for miracles. They donated nickels, dimes, and quarters to see the image. Some came more than once” (Estevis 69). </p>

			<h3>Values</h3>
			<p>Throughout the book’s story, many things happened that told the reader about how the Mexican lifestyle was. When Mexican people newly moved to the united states, there was a lot of commotion and chaos as people were very poor, and lots of families were separated due to the harsh immigration laws. This makes the weak a target for money. Poor Mexican communities are one of the most common places where violence and crimes happen. According to a survey conducted by Melinda Haley, a student from Walden University, “55 percent of Hispanics reported bearing witness to violence,” (Haley). In Anne Estevis’, Down Garrapata Road, Sheriff Hunsacker was speaking about Evistaro Maldonado’s death. According to him, when Nilda asked if he had drowned, the sheriff replied, “‘Absolutely not. He was knifed,’”(Estevis 110). The sheer amount of violence going on today in Mexican communities proves the fact that everyone in Mexican families protects one another, no matter the age. Nilda, a character in the book, protects her sister at all costs from bullies and crimes happening around her community. Clearly, to these individuals, nothing is more important than family.</p>

			<h3>Symbols</h3>
			<p>Whenever one thinks of the Mexican culture, he/she probably thinks of the food, and the ancient Aztec temples, etc. But nowadays, a primary viewpoint of the mexican culture seems to be its poverty. This is not a misinterpretation, and this surely is the case for a lot of Mexican-American communities near the border. As depicted in the article, the typical viewpoint of the Mexican Community is that there is poverty due to a “messy tangle of bad economic and immigration policy,” (Lee). In Anne Estevis’, Down Garrapata Road, Tia Piña looks at an empty plate and says to Chatita, “We need to see if we can reduce the eating, novio. We don’t want to use too much of our rations,” (Estevis 27). The scarcity of food is reflected in the empty late that was shown by Tia Piña. The empty plate was a perfect symbol of poverty denoting that even with food available, it has to be rationed in order to feed people equally. </p>
